# Jamify (Spotify Clone)

Welcome to [Jamify](https://jamify.onrender.com) 

## Overview :

Jamify is a clone of Spotify, a music streaming service that offers their users a vast library of music,podcasts and more. On Spotify, users are able to play a song, create their own playlists and much more. Unaware of how difficult cloning the actual website is, I threw myself into it, I decided to clone Spotify purely based off of the extensive personal use of the app. ( I always have headphones in where ever I go c: ) However, cloning Spotify has been an invaluable learning experience, learning and researching things as I went along really made me feel like a software developer. The list of technologies I used for my project is as follow: 

- Languages: Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS
- Frontend: React-Redux (Javascript)
- Database: PostgreSQL (Ruby on Rails)
- Hosting: Render
- Asset Storage: AWS Simple Cloud Storage(S3)
- Other: React-H5-Audio-Player, 


### Future Implementations
- Completing Playlist Functionality
- Ability To 'Like' A Song & A Liked Songs Playlist
- Artist's Show Page
